# 0.0.901

* Progress on tests and generating simulated data

* Adds code for Callaway and Tsyawo (2023) that is based on exploiting staggered treatment adoption to generate additional moment conditions in order to recover the parameters of an interactive fixed effects model for untreated potential outcomes.

# 0.0.900

* Initial version, includes code for Callaway and Karami (2023) that is based on using a time-invariant covariate with a time-invariant effect on untreated potential outcomes to identify the parameters of interactive fixed effects model for untreated potential outcomes.
